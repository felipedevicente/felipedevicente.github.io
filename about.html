  <main class="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Felipe De Vicente is a visual, digital, abstract, multimedia artist and electronic musician from Brazil, with national and international recognition.</p>

  <p>He has a degree in Visual Arts from the University of Franca, and lato sensu postgraduate degrees in Art Therapy, Arts Teaching Methodology and Art, Culture and Education.</p>

  <p>His works range from lyrical abstractionism, through geometric abstractionism, to abstract expressionism. Standing out, almost always, the use of vibrant colors, geometric shapes and the use of the digital platform as a means of creation.</p>

  <p>His works have already been selected to participate in several national and international exhibitions, fairs and biennials, such as the Florence Biennale, Italy, as well as other countries: England, Portugal, Spain, Japan, among others. He has participated in numerous physical and virtual exhibitions, national and international.</p>

  <p>In 2021, with the great national and international wave of NFTs, he decided to produce his first crypto arts on the Tezos network. His Abstract Pixel Art series is his best known and most valued work within the NFT community, although he has produced other series and works on the Polygon network.</p>

  <p>His artistic production within the NFT segment remains active, evidencing his extensive chromatic research and its developments, as the main motto of his works. As a musician, Felipe uses excerpts from his own electronic music to compose multimedia works with his NFTs works.</p>

  <p>In electronic music, he blends house, techno, ambient, IDM, drum and bass, downtempo, minimal, drone music, experimental, crafting immersive soundscapes with textured atmospheres, fragmented rhythms, and evolving sonic layers. Each track is paired with his visual artwork, creating a multimedia dialogue where sound and image converge to offer rich sensory experiences.</p>

  <p>His main influences in the visual arts are the artists: Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian and Kazimir Malevich, as well as the movements: Concretism, Suprematism, Constructivism, and Neoplasticism. In electronic music his main influences are: Ryuichi Sakamoto, Kraftwerk, Autechre and Alva Noto.</p>

  <p>By integrating image and sound, Felipe De Vicente proposes a sensorial aesthetic that dissolves the boundaries between seeing and hearing.</p>
